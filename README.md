# Test 1: Implement a Generic Function to Filter an Array of Objects Based on Given Criteria (10min)

**Description:**
Write a TypeScript function named **`filterByAttribute`** that filters an array of objects based on criteria provided as an object. The function should return a new array containing only the objects that match all attribute values specified in the criteria object.

**Requirements:**

- The function should accept two parameters:
  1. **`items`**: an array of any objects.
  2. **`criteria`**: an object where keys are the attributes to filter by and values are the corresponding values to match.
- The function should work with any set of attributes and should be able to handle different data types (string, number, boolean, etc.).
- Implement this in TypeScript to utilize type checking to ensure attributes exist on the objects and are of a compatible type.

# Test 2: Complete a React/Next.js To-Do List App (20min)

**Description:**

The ToDo app can currently add tasks, but doesn't support deleting tasks nor setting them as completed, lacks styling for completed tasks. And does not persist data.

**Instructions:**

- Implement a function to allow deleting tasks.
- Implement a function to allow setting tasks as completed.
- Modify the app to style completed tasks differently (e.g., green color & strike-through text).
- Ensure that the application persists the data if the page is refreshed (hint: use local storage).

You'll get bonus points for writing clean maintainable code, and for refactoring the esixting code.
